## current state

bit of a shambles

- jumping animation is very glitchy (lib/player.lua line 39)
- standing still animation is WONDERFUL (lib/player.lua line 19)
- ... but hard to understand

## TODO list
  
- a flip animation (see the tiny and transparent gif linked here: 
  https://piskel-imgstore-b.appspot.com/img/95f65ab0-748d-11ea-9fe5-f95612220874.gif)
- a flip is a heavier animation and it will trigger a sound on a tile upon landing
